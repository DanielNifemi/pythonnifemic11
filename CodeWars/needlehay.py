# Can you find the needle in the haystack?
# Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"
# After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:
# "found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:
# Example(Input --> Output)
# ["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5"
# Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"

def find_needle(haystack):
    position = 0
    for range in haystack:
        if range == 'needle':
            return 'found the needle at position %s' % position
        else:
            position += 1
